# Multivariate Mathematical Morphology Probing

If you have a multivariate (multichannel) image and want to detect specific shapes, such as disks of particular color and size, this research work is meant to assist you.

## About

This package was developed during my internship at XLIM for the purpose of detecting neurons and ganglias in Light sheet microscopy images (2 channels, 3D images, about 20Gb each) of the Intrinsic cardiac nervous system. It focuses on multivariate mathematical morphology probing and filtering.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **doc:** Documentation related to the project.
- **lib:** Contains the package code for multivariate mathematical morphology probing.
- **src:** Source code and scripts.
- **example:** Example usage and demonstration files.

## Usage

Here's a brief guide on how to get started with this package:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Haydarjammoul/multivariate-mathematical-morphology.git
